## To set up your environment:

1) Open Eclipse and go to `help > Eclipse Marketplace...` and then search `javafx` and install `e(fx)clipse 3.0.0`

2) Clone this repository using Eclipse (or just use Github Desktop/Git CLI and then import the project into Eclipse)

3) Install [JavaFX Scene Builder](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/javafxscenebuilder-1x-archive-2199384.html) (I'm using version 1.1) to create and modify `.fxml` files.

4) In Eclipse go to `Window > Preferences` then click on JavaFX and set the SceneBuilder executable to the downloaded Scenebuilder executable. I used the default install location and my path is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Oracle\JavaFX Scene Builder 1.1\JavaFX Scene Builder 1.1.exe`.

5) Now right click on `.fxml` files and click on `Open with SceneBuilder` to edit them, and you should be able to just run `Main.java`.

Let me know if it doesn't work.
